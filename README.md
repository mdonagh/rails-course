# Rails/Javascript Introductory Course

Learning programming from a coding bootcamp in the Seattle area opened up a whole new world for me. I went from making minimum wage to first 2x, and then 4x as much. 

Programming itself also is more important now than it ever was before, because more and more of human activity takes place digitally. Banking, shopping, socializing - all of it has moved online. There are currently 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide, and as the rest of the world's economy expands, more and more people will be able to afford a device with internet access.

I want you to be able to learn enough programming to make a career shift and become a full-time web developer so that you can make more money and have a more fulfilling career. If you have any questions or comments about this course, get in touch with me on Discord.

Learning web development will not only transform your career, but it will give you new insights and appreciation for the various kinds of software that you are already using in your life.
