There are several easy ways to run javascript. One of them is to use Node.js to run .js files.

See if you have node installed:

```
which node
/usr/local/bin/node
```

There we go, I've got node installed. If you don't have node installed, just google "how to install node" and follow the instructions.

Then, create a javascript file.


Here's an easy one - 

```
for(var i = 0; i < 15; i++){
  console.log(i);
}
```

"i" stands for "iterator" ( I think??? lol), but you can name the variable anything here.

```
for(var num = 0; num < 15; num++){
  console.log(num);
}
```

Save this loop to a file, `count.js`

```
node ./count.js
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
```
There we go, it printed the numbers!

You can also open a javascript REPL session using Node by just running `node`. Copy-paste the for loop into the REPL session and it will also run. Exit the REPL session with control+c.

A third way is to open Google Chrome, right-click and choose developer tools, click "console", and copy-paste the for loop into the console.

A fourth way is to create a simple HTML file, open it in a web browser, and embed javascript in it.

```
<html>
<script>
for(var num = 0; num < 15; num++){
  console.log(num);
}
</script>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Save this to `hello.html` and then open it in your web browser and go to the console.

You will see the same numbers printed.

Though there are lots of websites that will run Javascript for you, I recommend you do one of the above so that you will keep a saved version of your coursework for reviewing later.
