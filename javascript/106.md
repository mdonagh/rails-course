The below pokemon HTML page is a simple "game" (lol) that demonstrates how to make an HTTP request using javascript's fetch

Here's a video about fetch.

Fetch can be used to make any HTTP requests.

Javascript "promises" are a bit difficult to understand and work with. Basically `.then` forces the promised variable to resolve into something that you can use. Look for more youtube videos about javascript promises until you feel like you can understand it.

This uses the Pokemon API, which returns data about a pokemon to GET requests in the form of JSON, or javascript object notation.

I hope you can see how this assignment builds on the previous assignments - event listeners using `OnClick()`, writing HTML to the page, getting random numbers, etc.

We are choosing a random pokemon with these lines:

`let num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 500)`
``https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${num}``

I'm not sure how many pokemon there actually are - you can try increasing the random number to the highest pokemon ID to ensure the random number will include all pokemon :-D

I understand that what I'm asking for here will be pretty challenging. But your job as a web developer is taking business logic, which is similar to the game logic that is below, and translating it into code. 

If you cannot figure out how to do one of the below, then feel free to ask me in Discord and we can schedule a 1:1 where I show you how to implement it. I may make a Youtube video eventually explaining how to do this since I think this is a pretty good challenge/exercise to learn Javascript.

0. Display the last actions that have been taken (cap this at 5, remove older actions after 5). Should be like "did X damage! You tried to catch it and failed. Got knocked out!"

1. When you catch a new pokemon, let them give it a nickname. Display the nickname

2. Let them choose from 3 random pokemon at the beginning.

3. In a fight, let them choose one of their pokemon to fight the other pokemon. Use the back_sprite so that it looks like the user's pokemon is facing their pokemon.

4. Have the other pokemon do damage to your pokemon

5. Instead of an HP, display a health bar based on hp / base_hp

6. Have the enemy pokemon do damage to your pokemon. Have this based on their attack/defense stats somehow - your pokemon's damage should also be calculated based on attack/defense and BONUS POINTS the type of the pokemon

7. If the enemy pokemon gets knocked out, then remove it from play, they can't catch it.

8. Keep track of the HP of all your pokemon. If they get knocked out, you can't use them anymore

9. Try to put in animations where you throw a pokeball - or at least display an image when the pokeball is being thrown

10. add a game over screen if the user doesnt have any pokemon left
