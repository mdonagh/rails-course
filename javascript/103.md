This is meant to be an intro to iterating and if/else statements using javascript

Here is a for loop that will print only even numbers up to 100

```
for(var i=0;i<100;i++){
  if(i % 2 == 0){
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

The percent sign returns the remainder of dividing the number by 2. If the number is even, it will be 0, so console.log(i) only runs for even numbers.

Create a .js file that will only print odd numbers up to 100
Create a .js file that will only print numbers divisible by 3 up to 1000

```
for(var i=1000;i>0;i--){
  if(i % 2 == 0){
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

Here, this will print the numbers in reverse. The first statement in the for loop sets the iterator variable. The second one is a condition that determines how many times the loop will run. The third one, i++, increments or adds one to the number for each time the loop runs. i-- does the opposite and subtracts one.


Create a .js file that will only print numbers divisible by 5 from 1000 down to 0. If the number is not divisible by 5, print the statement "6 is NOT divisible by 5"


Another method of iterating is to use while loops
```
count = 0
while(count < 100){
  console.log(count)
  count = count + 1
}
```

Remember to iterate the count or while statements will result an infinite loop!
