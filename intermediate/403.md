ASSIGNMENT 

Time to PIMP your rails app! Twitter Bootstrap, when installed, offers a bunch of really nice-looking elements that make your website look 10x more professional with minimal work. There are also alternatives to boostrap you can google such as google materialize.

Give your app a makeover by using as many styles from one of these CSS frameworks as you can.

BONUS - create a second version of the same app that uses a different CSS framework so you can get a better feel for what these products offer.

BACK TO FORMS

Rails forms must have an authenticity token for security. These can be added as seen below.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/941594/understanding-the-rails-authenticity-token

```
<form action="/patients/create" method="post">
  <%= csrf_meta_tag %>
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

This is an HTML-style form in rails. It inserts the authenticity token. 

You can see the method - that can be GET (though that's uncommon/weird), DELETE, PUT, PATCH, or POST. These are HTTP verbs that correspond to what the form does.

Unfortunately, it seems that many beginners struggle to understand how to use the Rails forms helpers which are commonly used. They're just annoying and counterintuitive and don't really build on HTML knowledge that much - Rails is guilty of having too much "Magic" happening under the hood. So use the form style above and once you can use that one then you can try to use the rails form helpers.
