Email Notifications
https://launchschool.com/blog/handling-emails-in-rails

Not sure the easiest way to set up email sending from scratch - I remember gmail will give you the credentials but it might be easier to use another provider, just google "sending emails in rails" until you find something easy to use.

Use another rails model callback - after_create - to send an email notification each time a new employee is added to a company.

I like Mailinator for throwaway emails. So make sure each company has their own email address company.email_address where the notifications are sent - so burgerking@mailinator.com is notified of the burger king employees added, mcdonalds@mailinator.com is notified when mcdonalds employees are sent.
