# 8 Clone a static site

Choose any simple static website with a few different pages. Without copying the source code directly, use bootstrap/CSS/Rails to create a clone of the site.

This is to make sure you are familiar with bootstrap, layout, and CSS. Bootstrap is VERY commonly used for creating apps that can be viewed on mobile phones as well as desktops.

Creating hyperlinks in rails:

```
Create a controller
Something like Pages - doesnt matter what it is
to link between pages
then make a route for each page
so in routes.rb
get '/about' => 'pages#about'
then have an empty method
in pages

def about
end

this will render views/pages/about.html.erb automatically
What may be useful also is to use a url parameter in the pages controller
so get 'pages/:page => 'pages#show'
Then
use the URL param
to choose which page to render

def show
render params[:page]
end

This way you just need one route/controller method
The links themselves are just
<a href="/about"> About page</a>
For better style you should learn to use the Rails link_to helper
