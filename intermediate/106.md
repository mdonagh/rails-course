Use nutrionix API to allow the user to estimate how many calories a food item is. They enter a food - for example, nachos. Save user entries to the database and display them in a list view along with caloric estimate, along with the datetime they ate the meal.

Learning Goals:
Create a table in your database for meal.
In the controller method, make a call to the Nutrionix API and then save the result to that row in the database

So the user puts in "nachos"

In the controller method, before saving "nachos", make a call to Nutrionix and get "650 calories" (or whatever it returns). Save that to the same row. Should be as simple as 

`@meal.calories = response.data.calories` 

(or something like that)

Use a POST request with a custom form to make requests to an external API
