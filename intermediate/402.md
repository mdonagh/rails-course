More about views

partials

A partial is a smaller view that can be reused between views. You pass "locals" or local variables to it so that it knows what to do.

```
<%= render 'form', post: @post %>
```

views/layouts

application.html.erb is rendered on every page in your Rails app. Layouts can also be used to share styles between different pages within a controller - look into it.

SESSION VARIABLE

This isn't really relevant to views, but I want you to use it on your next assignment. You can store information pertaining to the current user session in the session variable - google "rails session variable". session[:history]


ASSIGNMENT - create a history bar in your rails monorepo

Create a data structure in session that keeps track of the last 4 pages the user was on. Use application.html.erb, a session variable, AND a partial to display them at the top of each page. Link back to them, so the user can click on them to go back to their recent pages.

I would think it would look like this

```
session[:history].push({url: "/patients/index", name: "Patients Index"}
```

But it can be whatever you want
