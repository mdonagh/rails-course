Create CRUD to book appointments at a hospital. Create plausible column names and table organization for

patient
appointment (must have start time and end time)
doctor

Make sure each of these can be CRUD

This builds on the previous assignments. I just want you to learn how to use datetime inputs. Try installing JQueryUI datetimepicker, or use the HTML 5 date input (which only works on some browsers).

JQueryUI is extremely commonly used.

Guide:
Use scaffolding to create the three tables.

Add some test data using the scaffolding forms.

Appointment belongs to patient and doctor. This can probably be achieved through scaffolding

Install JQueryUI from a CDN. You just include the CDN link in your app header, then you have access to JQueryUI elements.

Make sure the start-time and date-time input have the DATE type in your database and the form elements are appropriate datetime pickers using JQueryUI. Dates are difficult/finicky to get the hang of and are very commonly used.
