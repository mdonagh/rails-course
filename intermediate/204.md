# 13 exporting users
Create a user model/table with first name, last name, phone and a full american address. Open rails console to populate the database with lots of fake users. (Heroku free tier DB limit is 10,000 rows so maybe 9,000 users). Display these users on Heroku with pagination. (google rails pagination gem and use one of those). 

Add a button to the rails view, "export as CSV", which exports all users to a CSV the user downloads.
