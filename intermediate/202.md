Learning Goals:
Using Ruby outside of Rails framework
creating a command-line interface (CLI) application 

Save your code as blackjack.rb. Then, run it with ruby blackjack.rb when you're in the same folder.

I want you to write at least one rspec unit test for this.

Tests allow you to ensure that your code returns what you expect. So a simple example

```
hand = [5,5]

get_hand_value(hand)
hand.cards.sum
end

it 'gets hand value correctly'
hand = [5,5]
expect(get_hand_value(hand).to eq(10)
end
```

So here you create an expectation and ensure your code aligns with it.

Using rspec to create a unit test
Hopefully you can use object-oriented programming for this assignment.

This means creating classes, instantiating objects, and using them to store the state of your application.
