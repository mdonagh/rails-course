Stripe API

The stripe API is pretty easy to use and uses fake money. Create a Rails app that sells 3 fake products (can be anything - cars, televisions) using the stripe API.

So go to stripe, google "rails stripe tutorial", create a stripe account, and then figure out how to use their API to sync up with your Rails app. This should work very similarly to the Nutrionix API. You can confirm it's working as expected from your Stripe console where you should be able to see your transaction.

Post screenshots of your Stripe dashboard in your assignment in your README.md to prove it is working with Stripe.

Record all purchases in a database and display them on another page.

The only requirement is you integrate with STripe API. here's an example outline of how I imagine it:

devise user login

Purchases page

Shop page

Shop page has three items - let's say they are

iphone
Samsung

When user selects "buy iphone", then you make an API call to Stripe API which has that user's email show as purchasing the iphone.

There is a test credit card number - https://stripe.com/docs/testing

Then, on the Your Purchases page, they can see their purchases and their price. The data should be the same as what you see in the Stripe console.

You can use this to make purchases on your test account, where it works the same as production but with phony test money.
